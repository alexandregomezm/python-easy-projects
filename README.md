# python-easy-projects
 I'm trying this easy projects from leetcode, youtube and what comes from my mind to get better at python syntax.
 At the moment, i seeing videos of people coding some of these problems and then trying to do them on my own. Also, i tell chatgpt the idea and how i would do it to resolve the problem, read the code and write it down on my own.
