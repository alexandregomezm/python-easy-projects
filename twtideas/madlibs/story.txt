Today, I went to the zoo with my best friend, <name>. We saw a very <adjective> <animal>. It was so <adjective> that we couldn't stop laughing. After that, we decided to feed the <plural_noun>. I gave them some <food>, and they all started <verb>ing around us.
Then we took a break and ate some <snack>. While eating, we noticed a <adjective> <animal> trying to steal our food! <name> quickly grabbed the <object> and chased it away.
It was such an <adjective> day at the zoo. I can't wait to go back and see all the <plural_noun> again!
